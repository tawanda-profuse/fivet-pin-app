# Pin App üìå

This apps main purpose is to maintain user data on a dashboard. The user can add items to the dashboard and ideally unpin them. The data entered by a user remains consistent until further changed. The database in use stores the following fields:

- `**item_name**`
- `**page_name**`
- `**color**`

## Tools

This application makes use of several components which combine to make an integrated system. The tools used to build this application are:

- MongoDB - for storing value fields **(npm install mongoose)**.
- Express (server) - manages routing and page navigation.
- HTML - defines the elements to be laid out.
- EJS - Very useful for creating UI templates **(npm install ejs)**.
- CSS - Further defines layout and controls margins, colors, and positioning.
- JavaScript - takes care of application backend logic.

## Future Goals

I look forward to re-building this app using the React front end library and possibly extending the functionality.

## Accessibility

This application is hosted on Heroku as a Node.js dyno with GitHub continuous deployment enabled. It is available [here]().
